# Gintropy: Gini Index Based Generalization of Entropy

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the concepts presented in the paper "Gintropy: Gini Index Based Generalization of Entropy." The project is structured into two main Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **Gintropy.ipynb**
   - Implements the mathematical formulas and concepts of Gintropy.
   - Generates the figures and visualizations presented in the paper.

2. **Gintropy-Report.ipynb**
   - Provides a detailed report summarizing the formulas and applying them to a series of graph structures.
   - Includes analyses and results that demonstrate the utility of Gintropy in graph-based contexts.
   
Additionally, the full paper **Gintropy.pdf** is included in the repository for reference.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hghaemi/Gintropy-Paper.git
   cd Gintropy-Paper
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Jupyter Notebook and other dependencies manually if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy networkx pandas
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Open the notebooks using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Explore the implementation in **Gintropy.ipynb**.
3. Review the analysis and results in **Gintropy-Report.ipynb**.
4. Graph images will be saved automatically in the `graph_images` directory.
